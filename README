Inotify with FFI 

First version will only support inotify.
Second major version should support kqueue (for file watching)
  - and also fall back to file and directory polling when all else fails.

Goals:
  - to provide a rubyish api to inotify
  - to integrate with eventmachine, replace current EM::watch_file and support
    directories and more.
  - to still be useful outside EM
  - to work in major rubies (mri, yarv, jruby, rubinius?)

Example tool:

% ruby test.rb /var/log
Watching /var/log
Watching /var/log/xen
Watching /var/log/apparmor
Watching /var/log/exim4
Watching /var/log/ConsoleKit
<< Lots of files being watched, output trimmed .... >>
